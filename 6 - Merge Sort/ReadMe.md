# Merge Sort Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm. Merge Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm known for its stability and performance with large datasets.

## Implementation Details

The code consists of the following main components:
- `merge` function: This function merges two sorted subarrays into a single sorted array.
- `mergeSort` function: This function recursively divides the array into smaller subarrays and then merges them using the Merge Sort algorithm.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) with the command `g++ main.cpp -o mergesort`.
3. Run the executable file `mergesort`.

## Example

Suppose you have an array `{12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7}`. After running the Merge Sort algorithm, the sorted array will be `{5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13}`.

## Contributions

Contributions to improve the code or add enhancements are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.

## Time Complexity

- Average Case: `O(n*log(n))`
- Worst Case: `O(n*log(n))`
- Best Case: `O(n*log(n))`
