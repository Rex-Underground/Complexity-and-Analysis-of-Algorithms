# QuickSort Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the QuickSort algorithm. QuickSort is a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency in sorting large datasets.

## Implementation Details

The code consists of the following main components:
- `partition` function: This function is used to partition the array into two halves based on a pivot element.
- `quicksort` function: This function recursively sorts the array using the QuickSort algorithm.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) with the command `g++ main.cpp -o quicksort`.
3. Run the executable file `quicksort`.

## Example

Suppose you have an array `{11, 14, 1, 3, 4, 91}`. After running the QuickSort algorithm, the sorted array will be `{1, 3, 4, 11, 14, 91}`.

## Contributions

Contributions to improve the code or add enhancements are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.

## Time Complexity

- Average Case: `O(n*log(n))`
- Worst Case: `O(n^2)`
- Best Case: `O(n*log(n))`
