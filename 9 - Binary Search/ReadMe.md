# Binary Search Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Binary Search algorithm. Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target element in a sorted array.

## Implementation Details

The code consists of the following main components:
- `binarySearch` function: This function performs binary search on a sorted array to find a target element.
- `main` function: This function demonstrates how to use the `binarySearch` function to search for a target element in an array.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) with the command `g++ main.cpp -o binarysearch`.
3. Run the executable file `binarysearch`.

## Example

Suppose you have a sorted array `{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13}`. If you want to search for the element `7`, the algorithm will return the index `3` as the element `7` is found at that index in the array.

## Contributions

Contributions to improve the code or add enhancements are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.

## Time Complexity

- Average Case: `O(log(n))`
- Worst Case: `O(log(n))`
- Best Case: `O(1)`
